Objectives:

 *Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its characteristics, 
  distributions, correlations, and outliers.
 *Visualize the findings using various plots to gain insights into the data.
 

Key Activities:
 
  1.Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
  2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data.
    Data Exploration:
  3.Summary Statistics: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
  4.Distribution Analysis: Plot histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of 
    variables.
  5.Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize correlations between variables using heatmaps.
  6.Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers using scatter plots and box plots.
  7.Data Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create various plots for visualizing the 
    data.
  
Technologies Used:

  *Python: The programming language used for the analysis.
  *pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  *numpy: For numerical operations.
  *matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  *seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.
  
Key Insights:

  *Distribution of Variables: Histograms and box plots revealed the distribution of the data, 
   highlighting skewness and the presence of outliers.
  *Correlation between Variables: Heatmaps showed significant correlations between certain 
   pairs of variables, indicating potential relationships.
  *Outliers: Scatter plots and box plots identified outliers, which could be important for 
   further analysis or modeling.
